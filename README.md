# 👋 Hi there! I'm Patricia Kennedy  

A **Full-Stack Software Engineer** (PERN stack: PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js) and **AI Engineer in Training** with over 5 years of professional experience in tech.  

My journey started in IT support and infrastructure, where I built strong foundations in problem-solving and communication. I recently completed a **6-month Full-Stack Software Development program**, creating scalable, responsive web applications.  

Now, I’m expanding into **AI engineering** — blending my software background with **Python, LLMs, RAG pipelines, and AI Agents**. My mission is to build **real-world AI applications** that are intelligent, impactful, and user-friendly.
