# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Patricia Kennedy

A **Full-Stack Web Developer** with a strong background in IT support and over 5 years of experience in tech. My journey started in technical support and IT infrastructure, which built my foundation in problem-solving and clear communication. Now, Iâ€™m focused on full-stack development using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js) to create clean, user-friendly web applications.

I love collaborating, enjoy learning new technologies, and am always looking for ways to solve real-world problems. Open to remote or local opportunitiesâ€”letâ€™s connect!sion for modern web technologies. Currently, I'm building scalable and interactive web applications, and I love creating projects that are impactful, user-friendly, and built to last.
