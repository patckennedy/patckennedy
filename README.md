## Hi there 👋
![Banner](https://github.com/patckennedy/branding-assets/raw/main/assets/banner_github.png)

# 👋 Hi, I'm Patricia Kennedy  

A **Full-Stack Software Developer** (PERN stack: PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js) with 5+ years of experience in IT and technical problem-solving.  

My journey started in **IT support**, where I built strong skills in **debugging, troubleshooting, and cross-team communication**. After completing a **6-month Full-Stack Bootcamp**, I’ve been focused on building **scalable, tested, and deployable web applications** with modern tools.  

Today, I’m sharpening the skills that make me industry-ready as a developer: 
- **JavaScript** (ES6+ fundamentals, async/await, array/object methods)  
- **TypeScript** (React + Node)  
- **Testing** (Jest, React Testing Library)  
- **Docker + CI/CD** (GitHub Actions)  
- **Security & Reliability** (Auth, Logging, Error Handling)  

⚡ **Career Note:** While Full-Stack development is my immediate focus, I’m also pursuing a **part-time AI/Python learning journey**. This enhances my foundation with skills in **LLMs, RAG pipelines, and AI agents** — preparing me for the future of intelligent applications.
