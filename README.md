# 👋 Hi there! I'm Patricia Kennedy  

A **Full-Stack Software Engineer** (PERN stack: PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js) with over 5 years of professional experience in tech.  

My journey started in IT support and infrastructure, where I built strong foundations in problem-solving and communication. I recently completed a **6-month Full-Stack Software Development program**, creating scalable, responsive web applications.  

Now, I’m focused on **career enhancements with Python and AI Engineering** — expanding my software background to include skills in **LLMs, RAG pipelines, and AI Agents**. My mission is to build **real-world applications** that are intelligent, impactful, and user-friendly.  

⚡ **Career Note**: While I’m on this Python & AI roadmap, I’m **still actively pursuing Full-Stack / Web Developer roles** (PERN stack).  
My software engineering career continues — these enhancements position me for hybrid **Full-Stack + AI** opportunities in the future.
