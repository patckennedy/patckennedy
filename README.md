A **Full-Stack Software Developer** (PERN stack: PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js) with 5+ years of experience in IT and technical problem-solving.  

My journey started in **IT support**, where I built strong skills in **debugging, troubleshooting, and cross-team communication**. After completing a **6-month Full-Stack Bootcamp**, I’ve been focused on building **scalable, tested, and deployable web applications** with modern tools.  

Today, I’m sharpening the skills that make me industry-ready as a developer: 
- **JavaScript** (ES6+ fundamentals, async/await, array/object methods)  
- **TypeScript** (React + Node)  
- **Testing** (Jest, React Testing Library)  
- **Docker + CI/CD** (GitHub Actions)  
- **Security & Reliability** (Auth, Logging, Error Handling)  

⚡ **Career Note:** While Full-Stack development is my immediate focus, I’m also pursuing a **part-time AI/Python learning journey**. This enhances my foundation with skills in **LLMs, RAG pipelines, and AI agents** — preparing me for the future of intelligent applications.

## 📂 Projects  

### 🔄 Skill Refreshers  
To strengthen my foundations across the stack, I’m building **refresher repos**.  
Each repo includes notes, exercises, and mini-projects — focused practice to reinforce core concepts.  

- **JavaScript Fundamentals Refresher** *(In Progress)*  
  🔗 [Repo Link](https://github.com/patckennedy/javascript-refresher) – Revisiting ES6+, async/await, array methods, and error handling.  
- **TypeScript Practice** *(Planned – coming soon)*  
  🔗 [Repo Link](#) – Exercises and mini-projects focused on TypeScript with React + Node.  


### 💼 Featured Portfolio Projects
- **DevHire** – Full-stack job board for developers (PERN + JWT auth).  
  🔗 [Repo](https://github.com/patckennedy/devhire-job-portal)  
- **Outdoor Adventures** – Team PERN project with JWT authentication and Zustand for state management.  
  🔗 [Repo](https://github.com/patckennedy/outdoor-adventures)  
- **Ticket Triage Lite** *(Planned – inspired by IT support experience)*  
  Role-based auth, logging, error handling, and monitoring.  
- **Service Catalog** *(Planned – currently designing)*  
  React + Node app with search/filter + Docker + CI/CD pipeline.
